# Game 4 in a row for console

* The game allows 2 modes - 2 players and playing against the computer.
* In computer mode, artificial intelligence is used with the help of dynamic programming using the Min Max algorithm with post pruning.
* Performance improvement using the memoization technique, saving the state of the tested game in the dictionary with the help of hashing and searching in O(1). Thus saving the state of repeated testing.
* The design of the system was done by object-oriented programming and its principles.
* An option to reuse the game logic, by separating the user interface from the logic, in the future, we will be able to create a web platform or a mobile application without changing the game logic.
